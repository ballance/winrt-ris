Blocking Issues
	xslt transform for details page


Advanced Search (separate page)
	see http://www.ris.bka.gv.at/bundesrecht

Search Results -> Detail -> Search Results transition: restore scroll position in GridView

Settings
	Purge all downloads

Store each search in a SQLite database
	Keep only ten latest searches (auto purge a good idea?)
	Keep copies of documents in local storage

Share contract
	from List of Search Results
	from Details of Document (doable once XSLT is in place)

Details page
	AppBar for "keep local" / "remove local"

Custom Url Scheme (Protocol Activation)
	ris://NORxxxxx for sharing [partially done, missing is navigation to detail page]

MainPage Search History & Downloads
	enabled item selection + appbar for deleting (todo: show appbar automatically when selecting item)

OnQuerySubmitted
	Store last value to page state to be able to go back to correct search result page

Detail Page
	Save as Html (so Word can pick it up)

Search startup - is it correctly using the new startup path?
